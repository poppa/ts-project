# ts-project

This is my personal Typescript project creator. There are no fancy-pancy stuff
here, it simply initializes a TS project in the way I would do it manually.

- This will **NOT** be a NPM installable package
- This will **NOT** try to meet any arbitrary needs
- This **IS** simply created to fulfill some of my peronal needs :D

But if you find it useful, feel free to use it as you wish. And I **WILL** merge
pull requests if they do not deviate too much from the goal of this _program_.
